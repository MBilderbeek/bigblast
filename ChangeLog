2003/03/21 Manuel
	* Several small fixes:
	  - random seed is now given after pressing space bar (better random)
	  - UFOs and asteroids are now also rendered when they have the same
	    coordinate as in the previous frame (which is a very rare case),
	    to prevent corruption of those graphics on screen
	* Continuing to attempt to fix tinkeroid bug (it works *often* now)

2003/03/21 Eric & Manuel

	* Moved shield energy decrease to ship.c 
	
2003/02/16 Manuel
	* Implemented optimalization by counting number of asteroids and
	  explosions already found when processing their arrays (not for

	* If you hit an asteroid with shield on, the shield energy gets a
	  penalty now

2003/02/15 Eric & Manuel

	* Corrected background bug (wasn't erased)
	* Added scores

2002/11/02 Manuel & Eric
	* Added autoshield at the beginning
	* Shield energy now used

2002/11/01 Manuel & Eric
